# Track and count

Collection of scripts to solve the detection-tracking-counting problem. 
The algorithm makes use of YOLOv5 for detection, of SORT for tracking and
of the DNN to count unique people from the set of snapshots (the later is not 
currently implemented).

## Content

- detect_and_track_yolov5_sort.py is the implementation of detect+track task
- run_tracker_on_colab.ipynb shows how to run the tracker on google colab. 
- folder 'theory' contains the slides with summary of theoretical approaches  

## TO DO:

- Deep SORT+YOLOv5
- Create a set of bbox snapshots for each ID
- **Counter**: NN to identify the number of unique people from the dataset
