# Project objective

The aim of this project is to count the number of unique people voting in a room during the day.
The project is devided into several steps:

1. Custom object (an urn) detection
2. People tracking
3. Counting unique people

Each of these tasks is a separate topic itself and could be generalized further to be used for other purposes.
For instance, **tasks 2 and 3** could be employed to count the number of unique customers in a shop *etc*.

## Custom object detection 

The implementation of custom object detection could be found in a folder *urn_detection_yolov5*. 
First, the dataset of urn pictures was collected (see *urn_detection_yolov5/collecting_urn_dataset.doc*
for details). Note that the dataset was already augmented with different brightness levels to simulate the 
effect of illumination in a room or bad camera settings. The dataset is downloaded with curl.
Then, **YOLOv5 detector** is applied with 2 classes of objects specified: an urn (custom object) 
and a person (coco object). The neural network is then fine tuned to learn about the custom 
object class. Finaly, the inference is done on a subset of data and the result is visualized.     

*NB*: Since an urn is a stationary object (i.e. it position is not supposed to change in time),
its dectection can be performed on a single (initial) video frame. Then, the urn coordinares could
be easily passed further to other frames without performing the detection task over and over again. 

## Track and count

In the second part we track people in a room using the tracking-by-detection paradigm.
As it has been done in the custom object detection section above, **YOLOv5** performs a person
detection on each single video frame. Then, the detections on different frames must be associated 
between each other to re-identify the same person. We employ **the SORT tracker** which combines
the Kalman filter to predict the state of the object and the Hungarian algorithm to associate
objects from the previous frames with objects in the current frame. My implementation of 
the SORT tracker inside the YOLOv5 inference script could be found in *detect_and_track_yolov5_sort.py*
Jupyter notebook *run_tracker_on_colab.ipynb* shows how to run the tracker on **Google Colab**.

The SORT tracker is written with numpy which creates problems in inference on GPU. As a result, 
one can run the tracker on CPU only. A nice alternative to the SORT tracker is a [Deep SORT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07402.pdf)
**The Deep SORT** adds a deep association metric to build an appearance model. The appearance 
features are then added to the motion models. Here we do not aim to implement this tracker into 
the inference script since such as [implementations already exist](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch).
But we use this implementation to see how it works for our problem (currently in progress).
